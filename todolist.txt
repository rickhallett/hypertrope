TODO LIST

Unique Selling Points...?

- This enthusiast often encourages others to get fitter
- These others often lack the knowledge to do some
- Most people would like a personal trainer, but not everyone can afford one

- The app will enable workout recording, results monitoring, tailored nutrition guidance, workout instruction (videos etc)
